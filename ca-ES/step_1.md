## Introducció

Brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on the International Space Station by showing them a message and the ambient air temperature on board using the Astro Pi computer's Sense HAT.

You will use the online Sense HAT emulator to create your program, so no extra hardware is needed — everything is done in a web browser.

Your completed program will be run in space on the International Space Station (ISS)! You will also receive a special certificate showing where exactly the ISS was when your program ran!

## title: Notes for teachers and mentors

This activity can be completed in an afternoon. Organise your students into teams of up to four, and let us guide them through writing a short Python program to show a personal message and the air temperature on the Astro Pi.

Read the [official guidelines document](https://astro-pi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Astro_Pi_Mission_Zero_Guidelines_2018_19_V12_pages.pdf){:target="_blank"} for Mission Zero.

You will need to register for the Mission Zero challenge to allow your team/s to participate.

+ Go to the [Trinket emulator Mission Zero page](https://trinket.io/mission-zero/register){:target="_blank"}.

+ Fill out the form and click **Submit**\*.

\* Please note that this registration form is available in English only.

The fields on the form include:  
Teacher/Mentor name  
Teacher/Mentor email address  
Teacher/Mentor phone number  
Organisation type (e.g. primary school, secondary school, library, Code Club, CoderDojo, etc.)  
Organisation name  
Organisation address  
Organisation city  
Organisation country  
Organisation postal code  
Team name  
Number of team members  
Names and ages of team members  
In which language did you access the Mission Zero guidelines?

+ An account will be created for you. Each account has its own **classroom code**, and you will need to tell your team/s what yours is when they are ready to submit their programs.

+ Display your classroom code somewhere visible, for example on a whiteboard or using a projector, and begin the activity.
    
    We have created [a printable two-page handout](https://astro-pi.org/astro_pi_mission_zero_project_print_out_v10_print/){:target="_blank"} that covers the key points of Mission Zero and that students and young people can use together with this online project.
