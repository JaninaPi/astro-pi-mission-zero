## What is an Astro Pi?

An Astro Pi is a space hardened Raspberry Pi computer with an add-on board called the Sense HAT, made especially for the Astro Pi mission. As well as having a joystick, the board adds the ability to record temperature, humidity, pressure and orientation, and to display information on a built-in LED matrix

For this mission, you will be using the Sense HAT emulator. The emulator is a piece of software which simulates all of the functions of the Astro Pi in your web browser.

Here is a real Astro Pi unit on the International Space Station, running some code written by students. This is where your code will eventually be run.

The emulator is a piece of software which simulates in your web browser all of the functions of the Astro Pi. The differences include:

- With the emulator, you can set the temperature, pressure and humidity yourself with sliders, whereas with a real Astro Pi these values are measured from the surrounding environment by sensors.

- The emulator lets you rotate the Astro Pi by using the mouse to click and drag it, whereas the real Astro Pi can actually be moved in the real world and its sensors can detect when and how it has been moved.
