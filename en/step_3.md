## What is a Sense HAT?

The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, made especially for the Astro Pi competition. The board adds the ability to sense temperature, humidity, pressure and orientation, and to output information using a built-in LED matrix, as well as having a joystick.

For this mission, you will be using the Sense HAT emulator. The emulator is a piece of software which simulates all of the functions of the Sense HAT in your web browser.

Here is a real Sense HAT inside one of the Astro Pi units on the International Space Station. This is where your code will eventually be run.

The emulator is a piece of software which mimics all of the functions of the real Sense HAT. The differences include:

- With the emulator, you can set the temperature, pressure and humidity yourself with sliders, whereas with a real Sense HAT these values are measured from the surrounding environment by sensors.

- The emulator lets you rotate the Sense HAT by using the mouse to click and drag it, whereas the real Sense HAT can actually be moved in the real world and its sensors can detect when and how it has been moved.
