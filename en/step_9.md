## Submit your entry

There are a few rules your code needs to follow before you can submit your entry to be run on the International Space Station. The list of rules at the bottom will light up green when you run the program.

+ Light up the LEDs
+ Take a temperature reading
+ Make sure your code is 1000 characters or less, not including blank lines
+ Make sure your message to the astronauts fits within 30 seconds or less, as this is how long your code will run for on the ISS
+ Avoid using any methods needing input
+ Only import from the `sense_hat`, `time` and `random` modules
+ Make sure you don't include any profanity

(Obviously this will change when the editor is ready, and I will add screenshots)

+ Once the rules are all green you are ready to submit, so press the **Continue** button.

+ If necessary, click on your country's flag to change the language the submission form is displayed in.

+ You will be asked to enter your classroom code, your teacher will tell you what this is.

+ Your teacher's name will appear. If this is the right teacher, press **Go to final form**

+ Enter your team name and the names of the team members. These will be printed on the certificate once your code is run in space, so make sure you spell them correctly!

+ Press the submit button to enter your code. Your teacher will get an email to confirm you are entered.

+ If you want to, you could share the link to your code on social media to let people know your code will be run in space!
