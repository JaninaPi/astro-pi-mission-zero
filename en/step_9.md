## Submit your entry

There are a few rules your code needs to follow so that you can submit it to be run on the International Space Station. If your code follows them, the rules at the bottom of the emulator will light up in green when you run the program.

1. Light up the LEDs
1. Take a temperature reading
1. Make sure your code is no longer than 1000 characters, not including blank lines
1. Make sure your message to the astronauts runs for no longer than 30 seconds, as this is how long your code will run for on the ISS
1. Avoid using any methods needing input
1. Only import from the `sense_hat`, `time`, and `random` modules
1. Make sure you don't include any profanity

+ Once the rules are all green, you are ready to submit, so press the **Continue** button.

+ You will be asked to enter your classroom code â€” your teacher will tell you what it is.

+ Your teacher's name will appear. If it is the right name, click **Go to final form**.

+ If necessary, click on your country's flag to change the language in which the submission form is displayed.

+ Enter your team name and the names of the team members. These will be printed on the certificate once your code is run in space, so make sure you spell them correctly!

+ Press the **Submit** button to enter your code. Your teacher will get an email to confirm your entry.

+ If you want to, you can share the link to your code on social media to tell people that code which you wrote will be run in space!
