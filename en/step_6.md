## Display an image

You can display a picture on the Astro Pi's LED matrix.

![Astronaut](images/astronaut-pic.png)

+ At the bottom of your script, create some colour variables to define the colours with which to draw your picture. You can use as many colours as you like, but in this example we'll stick to only two â€” white (`w`) and black (`b`).

```python
w = (255, 255, 255)
b = (0, 0, 0)
```

This time, we have given the colour variables single letter names, because in the next step, you are going to be typing them out many times, and single letters make it easier to see the picture you will develop.

+ Below these variables, create a list of 64 letters. Each letter represents one pixel on the LED matrix, and corresponds to one of the colours you defined.

Draw your picture by putting a variable where you want its assigned colour to appear. We have drawn an astronaut by using the black (`b`) pixels as the background and the white (`w`) pixels to draw the astronaut's space suit.

```python
picture = [
    b, b, w, w, w, w, b, b,
    b, w, b, b, b, b, w, b,
    b, w, b, w, w, b, w, b,
    b, w, b, b, b, b, w, b,
    b, b, w, w, w, w, b, b,
    b, b, w, w, w, w, b, b,
    b, w, w, w, w, w, w, b,
    b, w, w, w, w, w, w, b
]
```

+ Add a line of code to display your picture on the LED display.

```python
sense.set_pixels(picture)
```

+ Press **Run** to see your picture displayed.

+ You might want to add some code to include a short wait (or `sleep`) after the picture is displayed. This will give the astronauts time to see your picture before the next part of your message. At the top of your program, add:

```python
from time import sleep
```

Then, on the line after the one that displays your picture, add this code to wait for two seconds:

```python
sleep(2)
```

+ Perhaps your greeting for the astronauts could include a picture or a pattern, as well as or instead of a written message?
