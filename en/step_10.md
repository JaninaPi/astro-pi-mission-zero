## Challenge: more Astro Pi projects

Now that you have completed your mission, why not try out some other projects using the other sensors on the Astro Pi.

If you're feeling confident, how about taking part in [Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/missions/space-lab/)? Form a team of between two and six people and work like real space scientists to design your own experiment. Receive free computer hardware to work with and write the Python code to carry out your experiment. If you get flight status your code will be uploaded to the International Space Station and run for three hours (two orbits). Any data your code gathers in space – image or data files – are downloaded and returned to you for analysis.

Alternatively you might want to try out one of our other Astro Pi projects:

+ Get to know [how to use the Sense HAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat){:target="_blank"} and the other things it can do

+ Create some pretty [random sparkles](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-random-sparkles){:target="_blank"} on the LED Display

+ Create a [flappy astronaut](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/flappy-astronaut){:target="_blank"} game

+ Challenge your friends with a [marble maze](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-marble-maze){:target="_blank"} game

+ Recreate the old classic game of [pong](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-pong){:target="_blank"}
