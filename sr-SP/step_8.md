## Submit your entry

There are a few rules your code needs to follow so that you can submit it to be run on the International Space Station. If your code follows them, the rules at the bottom of the emulator will light up in green when you run the program.

1. Take a temperature reading
2. Light up the LEDs
3. Ensure your code runs all the way to the end without any errors occurring. If you have a `while True` loop in your code, you will need to press the **Stop** button in order to pass this rule.

Also make sure you have met the following criteria:

1. Make sure your message to the astronauts runs for no longer than 30 seconds, as this is how long your code will run for on the ISS
2. Avoid using any methods needing input
3. Only import from the `sense_hat`, `time`, and `random` modules
4. Make sure you don't include any profanity

Once the rules are all green, you are ready to submit.
